        "content": "Hi John! Great question. VAEs and GANs are both generative models but differ in their approach. VAEs learn to encode data into a latent space and then decode it back, optimizing for reconstruction. GANs, on the other hand, have a generator and discriminator that compete against each other. The generator creates fake data, and the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake. Let me know if you'd like me to explain further or provide examples!",
