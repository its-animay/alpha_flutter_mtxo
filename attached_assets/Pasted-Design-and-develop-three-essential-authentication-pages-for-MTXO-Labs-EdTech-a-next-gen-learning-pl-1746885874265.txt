The experience must be visually stunning in both Light and Dark modes, with a focus on futuristic branding, seamless transitions, and joyful UX for global learners.

🌗 1. Theme Design System (Dual Mode)
🌑 Dark Mode (Default):
Background: animated cosmic neural mesh or low-poly particle gradient

Cards: glassmorphism with glowing borders

Colors:

Primary: #00C8FF (Neon Cyan)

Secondary: Electric Violet, Deep Indigo

Inputs: soft-light glowing borders with subtle hover shine

Fonts: Sora, Inter, or Space Grotesk

🌞 Light Mode:
Background: gradient from #F8FBFF to #E0F0FF

Cards: semi-transparent white with subtle frosted glass blur

Shadows: soft, airy with long falloff

Accent colors: same as dark mode, but softened

Inputs: light gray with inner glow focus

Toggle: top-right 🌞 / 🌚 icon with animated rotation or sliding switch

Switching between themes must feel magical: apply smooth transitions using Framer Motion, CSS transitions, or styled-components.
